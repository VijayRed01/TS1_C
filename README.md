The issue i am facing is that the trackbar and the button works to a specific point and then it stops however if you scroll back after the point it stops, everything works fine again i have included a video example 

once the video plays and then reaches the end nothing works at all it just freezes and the screen doesnt change.

How to use.

once the application starts 

1) click browse and select the example folder

2) click upload

3) then double click the video name in the list box

*note : package folder not included if required will upload
